abstract = {The present study proposes an alternative approach following command-filtered integral backstepping principle to control the rotor side converter (RSC) of a doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG) based wind energy conversion system (WECS). This controller provides better benefit compared to the classical backstepping controller; since the errors introduced by the input signal differentiation is eliminated. This controller essentially stabilises the rotor speed by controlling the electromagnetic torque. The global stability of the overall closed loop system is established using Lyapunov criteria. Moreover, the parameters of the controller are optimally selected using comprehensive learning particle swarm optimisation (CLPSO) technique. The performance of the controller is compared with two other controllers, which include a classical proportional integral derivative (PID) and ΔΣ–based PID. The results of comparative investigation demonstrate that the proposed command-filtered integral backstepping controller is superior and could effectively control the RSC under various fault conditions.}

abstract = {The Doubly Fed Induction Generator based Wind Turbine (WT-DFIG) suffers from instability while steady-state operation if improperly controlled. This paper proposes and evaluates three Scalar strategies that ensure Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) and stabilize the WT-DFIG. Both of the generator electromagnetic torque – speed and the wind turbine mechanical torque-speed characteristics are taken into account. The DFIG steady-state stabilized MPPT characteristic is first examined and evaluated in conjunction with the ratio of the stator voltage to rotor voltage magnitude. Then a scalar control strategy based on Rotor Voltage and Frequency Magnitude Control (RVFMC) function as related to the selected stator voltage is proposed. Stabilized MPPT for any specified speed range at different operating conditions are presented. For DFIG steady state instability declaration, its developed torque is defined in forms of two main components, specified as induction torque components and synchronous torque components. The induction torque impacts on stability while MPPT at steady state is presented, and further approved by the WT-DFIG MPPT dynamic model. The three Scalar MPPT control algorithms are constructed based on a constrained Rotor Voltage Angle (RVA). The first one deal with maximizing the synchronous developed power (MSP), the second strategy optimizes the synchronous power to achieve higher stability at higher power capability (OSP) and the third strategy deals with gaining higher power at maximum efficiency (ME). The RVA is the shift angle with the stator voltage which may be considered as a load angle has been defined for each algorithm. Detailed performance characteristics are presented, compared and evaluated to recognize the gained power ratio, stability, and efficiency enhancement. The proposed techniques implementation is explained; the RVC controller design and a simplified block diagram of the prescribed independent voltage and frequency reference generator block diagram are provided.}@ARTICLE{8258886,

ABSTRACT = {This paper presents a novel methodology for frequency control of a microgrid through doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) employing battery energy storage system (BESS) and droop control. The proposed microgrid frequency control is the result of the active power injection from the droop control implemented in the grid side converter (GSC) of the DFIG, and the BESS implemented in the DC link of the back-to-back converter also in the DFIG. This methodology guarantees the battery system charge during operation of the connected DFIG in the network, and the frequency control in microgrid operation after an intentional disturbance. In order for the DFIG to provide frequency support to the microgrid, the best-performing droop gain value is selected. Afterwards its performance is evaluated individually and together with the power injected by the battery. The power used for both battery charging and frequency support is managed and processed by the GSC without affecting the normal operation of the wind system. The simulation tests are performed using Matlab/Simulink toolbox.},
